    <h3 class="push-1-8">Creating a Barbarian</h3>
    <p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?<br>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to "civilized" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Quick Build</h4>
    <p>You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in <strong>Strength</strong>, followed by <strong>Constitution</strong>. Second, choose the <strong>outlander</strong> background.</p>

    <h2 class="push-1-8">Class Features</h2>
    <p>As a barbarian, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Hit Points</h4>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Hit Dice:</span> 1d12 per barbarian leve1</p>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span> 12 + your Constitution modifier</p>
    <p><span class="cinnabar">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span> 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per barbarian level after 1st</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Proficiencies</h4>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Armor:</span> Light armor, medium armor, shields</p>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Weapons:</span> Simple weapons, martial weapons</p>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Tools:</span> None</p>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Saving Throws:</span> <strong>Strength</strong>, <strong>Constitution</strong></p>
    <p><span class="cinnabar">Skills:</span> Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Equipment</h4>
    <p class="push-1-8">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon</li>
      <li>(a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon</li>
      <li>An explorer's pack and four javelins</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Rage</h3>
    <p class="push-1-8">In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.<br>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:</p>
    <ul class="push-1-8">
      <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
      <li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>
      <li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.<br>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.<br>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Unarmoured Attack</h3>
    <p>While you are not wearing any armour, your Armour Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Reckless Attack</h3>
    <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Danger Sense</h3>
    <p>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Primal Path</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Ancestral, the Path of the Berserker, the Path of the Storm Herald, the Path of the Totem Warrior, or the Path of the Zealot. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and agaln at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
    <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
