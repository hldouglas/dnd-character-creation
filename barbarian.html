    <h2 class="text-center pad-t"><span class="gutter-1-2 island-1-4">Barbarian</span></h2>
    <p>The anger felt by a normal person resembles the rage of a barbarian in the same way that a gentle breeze is akin to a furious thunderstorm. The barbarian’s driving force comes from a place that transcends mere emotion, making its manifestation all the more terrible. Whether the impetus for the fury comes entirely from within or from forging a link with a spirit animal, a raging barbarian becomes able to perform supernatural feats of strength and endurance. The outburst is temporary, but while it lasts, it takes over body and mind, driving the barbarian on despite peril and injury, until the last enemy falls. <br>It can be tempting to play a barbarian character that is a straightforward application of the classic archetype—a brute, and usually a dimwitted one at that, who rushes in where others fear to tread. But not all the barbarians in the world are cut from that cloth, so you can certainly put your own spin on things. Either way, consider adding some flourishes to make your barbarian stand out from all others; see the following sections for some ideas.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Personal Totems</h3>
    <p>Barbarians tend to travel light, carrying little in the way of personal effects or other unnecessary gear. The few possessions they do carry often include small items that have special significance. A personal totem is significant because it has a mystical origin or is tied to an important moment in the character’s life—perhaps a remembrance from the barbarian’s past or a harbinger of what lies ahead.<br>A personal totem of this sort might be associated with a barbarian’s spirit animal, or might actually be the totem object for the animal, but such a connection is not essential. One who has a bear totem spirit, for instance, could still carry an eagle’s feather as a personal totem.<br>Consider creating one or more personal totems for your character—objects that hold a special link to your character‘s past or future. Think about how a totem might affect your character’s actions.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Tattoos</h3>
    <p>The members of many barbarian clans decorate their bodies with tattoos, each of which represents a significant moment in the life of the bearer or the bearer's ancestors, or which symbolizes a feeling or an attitude. As with personal totems, a barbarian’s tattoos might or might not be related to an animal spirit. <br>Each tattoo a barbarian displays contributes to that individuals identity. If your character wears tattoos, what do they look like, and what do they represent?</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Superstitions</h3>
    <p>Barbarians vary widely in how they understand life. Some follow gods and look for guidance from those deities in the cycles of nature and the animals they encounter. These barbarians believe that spirits inhabit the plants and animals of the world, and the barbarians look to them for omens and power. <br>Other barbarians trust only in the blood that runs in their veins and the steel they hold in their hands. They have no use for the invisible world, instead relying on their senses to hunt and survive like the wild beasts they emulate.<br>Both of these attitudes can give rise to superstitions. These beliefs are often passed down within a family or shared among the members of a clan or a hunting group.<br>If your barbarian character has any superstitions, were they ingrained in you by your family, or are they the result of personal experience?</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Creating a Barbarian</h3>
    <p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?<br>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to "civilized" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Quick Build</h4>
    <p>You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in <strong>Strength</strong>, followed by <strong>Constitution</strong>. Second, choose the <strong>outlander</strong> background.</p>

    <h2 class="push-1-8">Class Features</h2>
    <p>As a barbarian, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Hit Points</h4>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Hit Dice:</span> 1d12 per barbarian leve1</p>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span> 12 + your Constitution modifier</p>
    <p><span class="cinnabar">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span> 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per barbarian level after 1st</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Proficiencies</h4>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Armor:</span> Light armor, medium armor, shields</p>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Weapons:</span> Simple weapons, martial weapons</p>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Tools:</span> None</p>
    <p class="push-1-8"><span class="cinnabar">Saving Throws:</span> <strong>Strength</strong>, <strong>Constitution</strong></p>
    <p><span class="cinnabar">Skills:</span> Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Equipment</h4>
    <p class="push-1-8">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon</li>
      <li>(a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon</li>
      <li>An explorer's pack and four javelins</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Rage</h3>
    <p class="push-1-8">In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.<br>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:</p>
    <ul class="push-1-8">
      <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
      <li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>
      <li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.<br>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.<br>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Unarmoured Attack</h3>
    <p>While you are not wearing any armour, your Armour Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Reckless Attack</h3>
    <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Danger Sense</h3>
    <p>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Primal Path</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Ancestral, the Path of the Berserker, the Path of the Storm Herald, the Path of the Totem Warrior, or the Path of the Zealot. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and agaln at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
    <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Extra Attack</h3>
    <p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Fast Movement</h3>
    <p>Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Feral Instinct</h3>
    <p>By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.<br>Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated. you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Brutal Critical</h3>
    <p>Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a criticai hit with a melee attack. <br>This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Relentless Rage</h3>
    <p>Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.<br>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Persistent Rage</h3>
    <p>Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Indomitable Might</h3>
    <p>Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Primal Champion</h3>
    <p>At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.</p>

    <h2 class="push-1-8">Primal Paths</h2>
    <p>Rage burns in every barbarian's heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Path of the Ancestral Guardian</h3>
    <p>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.<br>Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Ancestral Protectors</h4>
    <p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn’t against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Spirit Shield</h4>
    <p>Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.<br>When you reach certain levels in this class. you can reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Consult the Spirits</h4>
    <p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the <em>augury</em> or <em>clairvoyance</em> spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.<br>After you cast either spell in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Vengeful Ancestors</h4>
    <p>At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your <strong>Spirit Shield</strong> to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Path of the Beserker</h3>
    <p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Frenzy</h4>
    <p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Mindless Rage</h4>
    <p>Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Intimidating Presence</h4>
    <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effeet ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.<br>If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Retaliation</h4>
    <p>Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Path of the Storm Herald</h3>
    <p>All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants
them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbar—
ians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn
to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic,
which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian
ofthis path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful
magical effects.
<br>Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train
alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect
nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in
regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the
world’s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.</p>
