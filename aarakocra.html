      <p class="max-length">As with much of their speech, aarakocra names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other people have a difficult time pronouncing them.

          <p class="push-0 milli">Backgrounds that are most appropriate for aarakocra include <strong>the outlander</strong>, <strong>the hermit</strong>, and <strong>the sage</strong>. The small colonies of aarakocra are insular and remote, and few aarakocra live away from their roosts. In the Star Mounts of the High Forest in the Forgotten Realms, no more than a few dozen aarakocra live away from the nests of their families. Those that do are usually <strong>rangers</strong> or <strong>fighters</strong>, constantly patrolling for outside threats.</p>
