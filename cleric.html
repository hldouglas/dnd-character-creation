    <p>Almost all the folk in the world who revere a deity live their lives without ever being directly touched by a divine being. As such, they can never know what it feels like to be a cleric—someone who is not only a devout worshiper, but who has also been invested with a measure of a deity’s power.<br>The question has long been debated: Does a mortal become a cleric as a consequence of deep devotion to one's deity, thereby attracting the god’s favour? Or is it the deity who sees the potential in a person and calls that individual into service? Ultimately, perhaps, the answer doesn’t matter. However clerics come into being, the world needs clerics as much as clerics and deities need each other.<br>If you’re playing a cleric character, the following sections offer ways to add some detail to that character’s history and personality.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Temple</h3>
      <p>Most clerics start their lives of service as priests in an order, then later realize that they have been blessed by their god with the qualities needed to become a cleric. To prepare for this new duty, candidates typically receive instruction from a cleric of a temple or another place of study devoted to their deity.<br>Some temples are cut off from the world so that their occupants can focus on devotions, while other temples open their doors to minister to and heal the masses. What is noteworthy about the temple you studied at?</p>

    <p class="push-1-8">As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody. Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.<br>Once you've chosen a deity, consider your cleric's relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Spellcasting</h3>
      <p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h4 class="push-1-8">Cantrips</h4>
      <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
      <p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do sp, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 gutter-1-2">
      <h4 class="push-1-8">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
      <p class="push-1-8">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <p><span class="cinnabar">Spell save DC</span> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br><span class="cinnabar">Spell attack modifier</span> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
      </div>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Ritual Casting</h4>
      <p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
      <p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Divine Domain</h3>
      <p>Choose one domain related to your deity: Forge, Grave, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Domain Spells</h4>
      <p>Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.<br>If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Channel Divinity</h3>
      <p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.<br>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.<br>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.<br>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h4>
      <p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.<br>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
      <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Destroy Undead</h3>
      <p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Divine Intervention</h3>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.<br>Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.<br>If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.<br>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 ] gutter-1-2 max-length">
      <h2 class="push-1-8">Divine Domains</h2>
      <p>In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortallife and civilization, called a deity's domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity's portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity's portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain.<br>Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus ("radiant") Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius ("healing"), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.<br>Each domain's description gives examples of deities who have influence over that domain. Gods are included from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign seltings, as well as from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of antiquity.</p>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Forge Domain</h3>
      <p>The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by ores, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armour and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
      <p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armour and smith’s tools.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Blessing of the Forge</h4>
      <p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armour. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armour or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon.<br>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing</h4>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items.<br>You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object. The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.<br>The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation.<br>The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Soul of the Forge</h4>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You gain resistance to fire damage.</li>
        <li>While wearing heavy armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Divine Strike</h4>
      <p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the fiery power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Saint of Forge and Fire</h4>
      <p>At 17th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You gain immunity to fire damage.</li>
        <li>While wearing heavy armour, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Grave Domain</h3>
      <p>Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Circle of Mortality</h4>
      <p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.<br>In addition, you learn the <em>spare the dying</em> cantrip, which doesn’t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Eyes of the Grave</h4>
      <p>At lst level, you gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn’t behind total cover and that isn’t protected from divination magic. This sense doesn’t tell you anything about a creature's capabilities or identity.<br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave</h4>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature’s life force for termination.<br>As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Sentinel at Death's Door</h4>
      <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled.<br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Potent Spellcasting</h4>
      <p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Keeper of Souls</h4>
      <p>Starting at 17th level, you can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When an enemy you can see dies within 60 feet of you, you or one creature of your choice that is within 60 feet of you regains hit points equal to the enemy’s number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren’t incapacitated. Once you use it, you can't do so again until the start of your next turn.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Knowledge Domain</h3>
      <p>The gods of knowledge—including Oghma, Boccob, Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth—value learning and understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Blessings of Knowledge</h4>
      <p>At 1st level, you learn two languages of your choice. You also become proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: <strong>Arcana</strong>, <strong>History</strong>, <strong>Nature</strong>, or <strong>Religion</strong>.<br>Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Channel Divinity: Knowledge of the Ages</h4>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to tap into a divine well of knowledge. As an action, you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts</h4>
      <p>At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it.<br>As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.<br>If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute.<br>During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the <em>suggestion</em> spell on the creature without expending a spell slot. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Potent Spellcasting</h4>
      <p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Visons of the Past</h4>
