    <p>In some campaigns, humanoids normally regarded as sinister threats can emerge to adventure alongside humans and the other standard races. This section is aimed at DMs who wish to expand the race selections for their campaigns beyond the typical folk of D&D.</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Why a Monsterous Character?</h3>
    <p>Creating characters as creatures normally cast as villains offers up some interesting roleplaying possibilities. Whether played for comedy, as a tragic story of betrayal and loss, or as an antihero, a monstrous character gives a player a chance to take on an unusual challenge in the campaign. Before allowing monstrous characters in your campaign, consider the following three questions.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Rare or Mundane?</h4>
    <p>Consider how common <strong>orc</strong>, <strong>goblin</strong>, and similar adventurers are in your setting. Are they regarded as no stranger than <strong>elves</strong> or <strong>dwarves</strong>? Are they met with suspicion? The role these races play in your setting should determine the kinds of reactions that such characters meet.<br>Don't be afraid to push things to an extreme. An <strong>orc</strong> character might have to venture into town in disguise or remain in the wilderness, for fear of imprisonment or mob violence. Be sure to talk to the group about how such characters can expect the world to treat them. Some players like the challenge of taking on an outcast, but don't set up one expectation and deliver another.<br>You can establish a monstrous creature as just another culture in your campaign, one that has alliances and rivalries with <strong>humans</strong>, <strong>elves</strong>, and <strong>dwarves</strong>. A <strong>hobgoblin</strong> kingdom might serve as a buffer between a <strong>human</strong> kingdom and a blighted region overrun by the spawn of Kyuss. <strong>Kobolds</strong> might be <strong>city builders</strong>, the architects of grand, heavily fortified edifices, which other folk dwell in for a price.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Outcast or Ambassador?</h4>
    <p>Consider how a monstrous character's native culture views the character. Is the character an <strong>outcast</strong>, a <strong>spy</strong>, an <strong>ambassador</strong>, or something else? Work with the player to determine how the character ended up as an adventurer.<br>The character's bond is a great starting point to consider for this question. How did the bond drive the character to adventure? The character's trait, flaw, and ideal can also play a role in fleshing out the story.</p>

    <h4 class="push-1-8">Friends or Enemies?</h4>
    <p>Figure out what special ties the character has to other members of the adventuring party. An <strong>orc warlock</strong> might be the <strong>dwarf ranger</strong>'s sworn enemy, but the two are forced to work together to defeat a mutual foe. Perhaps the <strong>kobold sorcerer</strong> was the <strong>tiefiing wizard</strong>'s familiar, transformed by an irate archmage in return for some petty insult. The <strong>hobgoblin paladin</strong> might have been <strong>human</strong> once, but crossed the wrong hag and was cursed to take on an evil guise. A creative tie between a monstrous character and the rest of the party helps make for a memorable campaign.<br>The Monstrous Origin table gives a number of ideas for adding a monstrous character to the campaign.</p>
