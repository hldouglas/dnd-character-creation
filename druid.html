  <p class="max-length gutter-1-2">Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.<br>Your druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how your character came to the profession.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Treasured Item</h3>
      <p>Some druids carry one or more items that are sacred to them or have deep personal significance. Such items are not necessarily magical, but every one is an object whose meaning connects the druid’s mind and heart to a profound concept or spiritual outlook.<br>When you decide what your character’s treasured item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you come by the item, and why is it important to you?</p>

      <p>It’s not unusual for would-be druids to seek out (or be sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the basics of their magical arts. Most druids who learn from a mentor begin their training at a young age, and the mentor has a vital role in shaping a student’s attitudes and beliefs.<br>If your character received training from someone else, who or what was that individual, and what was the nature of your relationship? Did your mentor imbue you with a particular outlook or otherwise influence your approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path?</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Creating a Druid</h3>
    <p class="push-1-8">When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.<br>Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.</p>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 ] max-length gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Druidic</h3>
      <p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 ] max-length gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Spellcasting</h3>
      <p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h4 class="push-1-8">Cantrips</h4>
      <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
      <p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level ar 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells,<br>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 gutter-1-2">
      <h4 class="push-1-8">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
      <p class="push-1-8">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <p><span class="cinnabar">Spell save DC</span> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br><span class="cinnabar">Spell attack modifier</span> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
      </div>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Ritual Casting</h4>
      <p>You can cast any druid spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
      <p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Wild Shape</h3>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.<br>Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.</p>

      </div>
      <p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to O hit points, or die.<br>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li>
        <li>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</li>
        <li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</li>
        <li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
        <li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Druid Circle</h3>
      <p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of Dreams, the Circle of the Land, the Circle of the Moon,or the Circle of the Shepherd. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
      <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Timeless Body</h3>
      <p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Beast Spells</h3>
      <p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Archdruid</h3>
      <p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.<br>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.</p>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 ] gutter-1-2 max-length">
      <h2 class="push-1-8">Druid Circles</h2>
      <p>Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuais are so isolaled that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters, Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.<br>At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Circle of Dreams</h3>
      <p>Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druids’ guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and where the weary can find rest.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Balm of the Summer Court</h4>
      <p>At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level.<br>As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 120 ft of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.<br>You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow</h4>
      <p>At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gleaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot—radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.<br>While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn’t visible outside it.<br>The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Hidden Paths</h4>
      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 30 ft to an unoccupied space you can see.<br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Walker in Dreams</h4>
      <p>At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.<br>When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: <em>dream</em> (with you as the messenger), <em>scrying</em>, or <em>teleportation circle</em>. This use of <em>teleportation circle</em> is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven't taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn’t wasted.<br>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">College of Lore</h3>
      <p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.<br>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.<br>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
      <p>When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Cutting Words</h4>
      <p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creatare that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Additional Magical Secrets</h4>
      <p>At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell yuu choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Peerless Skill</h4>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">College of Swords</h3>
      <p>Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.<br>Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade’s talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.<br>Blades who abandon their lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves’ guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
      <p>When you join the College of Swords at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and the scimitar.<br>If you‘re proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Fighting Style</h4>
      <p>At 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if something in the game lets you choose again.<br><span class="cinnabar">Dueling.</span> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.<br><span class="cinnabar">Two-Weapon Fighting.</span> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Blade Flourish</h4>
      <p>At 3rd level, you learn to perform impressive displays of martial prowess and speed.<br>Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if a weapon attack that you make as part of this action hits a creature, you can use one of the following Blade Flourish options of your choice. You can use only one Blade Flourish option per turn.<br><span class="cinnabar">Defensive Flourish.</span> You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You also add the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn.<br><span class="cinnabar">Slashing Flourish.</span> You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit and to any other creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.<br><span class="cinnabar">Mobile Flourish.</span> You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You can also push the target up to 5 feet away from you, plus a number of feet equal to the number you roll on that die. You can then immediately use your reaction to move up to your walking speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Extra Attack</h4>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Master's Flourish</h4>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, whenever you use a Blade Flourish option, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration die.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">College of Valour</h3>
      <p>Bards of the College of Valour are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
      <p>When you join the College of Valour at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapuns.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Combat Inspiration</h4>
      <p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Altematively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardie Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Extra Attack</h4>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Battle Magic</h4>
      <p>At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act. When yuu use your action to cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">College of Whispers</h3>
      <p>Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like other bards, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.<br>Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses a bard’s reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Psychic Blades</h4>
      <p>When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature’s mind.<br>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.<br>The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Words of Terror</h4>
      <p>At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror.<br>If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.<br>If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.<br>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Mantle of Whispers</h4>
      <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid’s persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest.<br>You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.<br>While you’re in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn’t include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.<br>Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check.<br>Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can’t capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature’s deepest fears.<br>As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.<br>On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.<br>The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.<br>When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear.<br>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
