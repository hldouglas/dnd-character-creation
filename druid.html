  <p class="max-length gutter-1-2">Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.<br>Your druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how your character came to the profession.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Treasured Item</h3>
      <p>Some druids carry one or more items that are sacred to them or have deep personal significance. Such items are not necessarily magical, but every one is an object whose meaning connects the druid’s mind and heart to a profound concept or spiritual outlook.<br>When you decide what your character’s treasured item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you come by the item, and why is it important to you?</p>

      <p>It’s not unusual for would-be druids to seek out (or be sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the basics of their magical arts. Most druids who learn from a mentor begin their training at a young age, and the mentor has a vital role in shaping a student’s attitudes and beliefs.<br>If your character received training from someone else, who or what was that individual, and what was the nature of your relationship? Did your mentor imbue you with a particular outlook or otherwise influence your approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path?</p>

    <h3 class="push-1-8">Creating a Druid</h3>
    <p class="push-1-8">When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.<br>Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.</p>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 ] max-length gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Druidic</h3>
      <p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 ] max-length gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Spellcasting</h3>
      <p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h4 class="push-1-8">Cantrips</h4>
      <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
      <p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level ar 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells,<br>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 gutter-1-2">
      <h4 class="push-1-8">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
      <p class="push-1-8">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <p><span class="cinnabar">Spell save DC</span> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br><span class="cinnabar">Spell attack modifier</span> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
      </div>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Ritual Casting</h4>
      <p>You can cast any druid spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
      <p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Wild Shape</h3>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.<br>Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.</p>

      <p class="push-1-8">You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to O hit points, or die.<br>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li>
        <li>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</li>
        <li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</li>
        <li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
        <li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Druid Circle</h3>
      <p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of Dreams, the Circle of the Land, the Circle of the Moon,or the Circle of the Shepherd. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
      <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Timeless Body</h3>
      <p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Beast Spells</h3>
      <p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Archdruid</h3>
      <p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.<br>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.</p>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 ] gutter-1-2 max-length">
      <h2 class="push-1-8">Druid Circles</h2>
      <p>Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuais are so isolaled that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters, Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.<br>At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Circle of Dreams</h3>
      <p>Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druids’ guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and where the weary can find rest.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Balm of the Summer Court</h4>
      <p>At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level.<br>As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 120 ft of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.<br>You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow</h4>
      <p>At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gleaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot—radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.<br>While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn’t visible outside it.<br>The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Hidden Paths</h4>
      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 30 ft to an unoccupied space you can see.<br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Walker in Dreams</h4>
      <p>At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.<br>When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: <em>dream</em> (with you as the messenger), <em>scrying</em>, or <em>teleportation circle</em>. This use of <em>teleportation circle</em> is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven't taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn’t wasted.<br>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Circle of the Land</h3>
      <p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is inl1uenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Bonus Cantrip</h4>
      <p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Natural Recovery</h4>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.<br>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Circle Spells</h4>
      <p>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells, At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid, Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark—and consult the associated list of spells. <br>Once you gain access to a circle spell. You always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Land's Stride</h4>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.<br>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <em>entangle</em> spell.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Nature's Ward</h4>
      <p>When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Nature's Sanctuary</h4>
      <p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.<br>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-8">Circle of the Moon</h3>
      <p>Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.<br>Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Combat Wild Shape</h4>
      <p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.<br>Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Circle Forms</h4>
      <p>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).<br>Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Primal Strike</h4>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Elemental Wild Shape</h4>
      <p>At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Thousand Forms</h4>
      <p>By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the <em>alter self</em> spell at will.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit [ unit-xs-1 unit-m-1-2 ] gutter-1-2">
      <h3 class="push-1-8">Circle of the Shepherd</h3>
      <p>Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.<br>Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Speech of the Woods</h4>
      <p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.<br>You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn’t grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Spirit Totem</h4>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 ft of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.<br>As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 ft to a point you can see.<br>The spirit persists for 1 min or until you’re incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<br>The effect of the spirit’s aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.<br><span class="cinnabar">Bear Spirit</span> The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.<br><span class="cinnabar">Hawk Spirit</span> The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.<br><span class="cinnabar">Unicorn Spirit</span> The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit’s aura. In addition. if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Mighty Summoner</h4>
      <p class="push-1-8">Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has.</li>
        <li>The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Guardian Spirit</h4>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your druid level.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-8">Faithful Summons</h4>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of <em>conjure animals</em> as if it were cast using a 9th-level spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 20 ft of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).<br>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

        <h2 class="push-1-8">Learning Beast Shapes</h2>
        <p>The Wild Shape feature in the Player’s Handbook lets you transform into a beast that you’ve seen. That rule gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility, making it easy to amass an array of beast form options for yourself, but you must abide by the limitations in the Beast Shapes table in that book.<br>When you gain Wild Shape as a 2nd—level druid, you might wonder which beasts you've already seen. The following tables organize beasts from the Monster Manual according to the beasts’ most likely environments. Consider the environment your druid grew up in, then consult the appropriate table for a list of animals that your druid has probably seen by 2nd level.<br>These tables can also help you and your DM determine which animals you might see on your travels. In addition, the tables include each beast’s challenge rating and note whether a beast has a flying or swimming speed. This information will help you determine whether you qualify to assume that beast’s form.<br>The tables include all the individual beasts that are eligible for Wild Shape (up to a challenge rating of 1) or the Circle Forms feature of the Circle of the Moon (up to a challenge rating of 6).</p>
